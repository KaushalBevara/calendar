FBLA Project 2022

Theme:
Create a mobile application for your school to help keep parents and the community up to date. The app needs to include upcoming events, important information such as school calendar and activities schedule, a way for teachers and students to share photos, and a way for parents to notify school of student absences. The app must also include one additional item that is recommended by your administration.

 - The app must be designed for a phone/tablet.
 - The operating system must be mobile based such as Android or iOS.
 - The app should state its licensing and terms of use.
